            <h2>About Cats</h2>
            <p class="r">Cats are beloved pets known for their agility, independence, and playful nature. They have been
                companions to humans for thousands of years, and their charm continues to captivate people worldwide.

                <div>
                    <img src="pictures/cats/Persian.jpg" alt="Persian">
                    <p>Persian</p>
                    <p>Big round eyes inside a round face give Persians their unmistakable look. Add in the flat face
                        and the distinctive profile, or smushed nose, and you know you’ve found a gorgeous, soft,
                        sweet-tempered Persian cat. Affectionate toward their owners, children, and other pets, Persians
                        are generally not very active, preferring a quiet environment. Averaging between 3-6 kg (7-12
                        lbs) as adults, they are on the smaller side but will provide lots of cuddling and companionship
                        during rest periods. Because of their semi-dense coats, they overheat easily and can require
                        professional grooming to prevent matted fur.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <img src="pictures/cats/Siamese.jpg" alt="Siamese">
                    <p>Siamese</p>
                    <p>Long and slender, Siamese may have an elongated, wedged-shaped face or a rounder, apple-shaped
                        one. Their ears, noses, paws, and tails come in complementary colours that offset their
                        cream-coloured bodies. With their short hair, they don’t require the combing and care that a
                        longhaired cat needs. They are playful and energetic and weigh between 3.5-5.5 kg (7-12 lbs).
                        Very vocal, they will keep you engaged in conversation.</p>

                    <p>Maine Coon</p>
                    <p>The gentle giants of the cat world, Maine Coons are magnificent when they reach their tallest
                        height of 16 inches, length of up to 100 cm (40 in) and weigh in at 3.6-8.2 kg (7-18 lbs) or
                        more. They have lovely tufts of fur in their ears and under their paws, a square face and a big
                        fluffy tail. They are friendly, inquisitive, and very hardy, meaning that they can live in a
                        variety of climates and require less care and attention than other breeds. That’s not to say a
                        Maine Coon won’t want attention. They love to be admired as much as the next fur baby. They are
                        curious and fascinated by water.</p>

                    <p>Ragdoll</p>
                    <p>Graceful and intelligent, Ragdolls are mild-mannered and sweet. Their large, striking blue eyes
                        are discerning as well as affectionate. Growing to anywhere between 6-9 kg (15-20 lbs), it takes
                        these long-haired beauties about three years to reach full maturity. They can be trained and
                        many are very good with children, making a Ragdoll cat an excellent family member.</p>

                    <img src="pictures/cats/Bengal.jpg" alt="Bengal">
                    <p>Bengal</p>
                    <p>Bengal cats have become very popular because they look like miniature (3.6-7 kg [8-15 lb])
                        leopards. Like Abyssinians, they are extremely curious and inquisitive. Without a lot of
                        attention and things to do to stay busy, they can become bored or frustrated which might lead to
                        undesirable behaviours. This is a breed of cat that loves water and may decide to go fishing in
                        your aquarium. While gorgeous, they are definitely not suited to every home.</p>
